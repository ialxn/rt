\section{Installation}

To compile and install \rt you need a C-compiler\footnote{\rt is only tested with gcc} and, ideally, {\tt (I)make}. In addition, the following libraries are needed: {\tt GSL}\footnote{Gnu Scientific Library, \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/}}, a C-version of BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra System) such as {\tt gslcblas} or {\tt Atlas}\footnote{\url{http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/}}, {\tt libconfig}\footnote{Version 1.4.6+, \url{http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/}}, and {\tt libpthread}. Please set (or modify) {\tt CCOPTIONS} in {\tt Imakefile}. Most probably, you will make sure that {\tt -O2 -g} is set. Run {\tt xmkmf -a} to have {\tt imake} build a {\tt Makefile} from the {\tt Imakefile} provided. Run {\tt make} to compile and build the binaries.



\section{Command line parameters}

{\bf Syntax:} \rt [options] {\tt <} input {\tt >} output 2 {\tt >} errors
\vspace{1em}
\begin{list}{}
{\setlength{\leftmargin}{3.5cm}
\setlength{\labelwidth}{3.0cm}
\setlength{\labelsep}{0.25cm}
\setlength{\rightmargin}{0.5cm}}

\item[{\tt [--append|-a]}] Append to output files. A new seed value for the random number generator is supplied with this parameter. This overrides the keyword {\tt seed} in the input file. Use this option to improve existing results by tracing additional rays and append to existing output files. Default mode is to truncate existing files.

\item[{\tt [--keep\_closed|-k]}] For each target one output file is produced. Unless this option is given all these files are kept open. For very large system you might thus run out of file descriptors\footnote{Typically 1024 file descriptor can be used per process. Query with {\tt ulimit -n}}. If this option is given, all per target output files are kept closed and only opened when buffers are written to them.

\item[{\tt [--Log|-L]}] Log the path of some rays in raw format (give number of rays to be used as parameter) for each source in file {\tt NNN.dat} with {\tt NNN} denoting the number (ID) of the source. Output format is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
x_start y_start z_start x_end y_end z_end
x_start y_start z_start x_end y_end z_end
.
\end{verbatim}
Start and end of each leg of the path is on a single line. Individual rays are separated by an empty line.  

\item[{\tt [--log|-l]}] Log the path of some rays in OFF format (give number of rays to be used as parameter) for each source in file {\tt NNN.OFF} with {\tt NNN} denoting the number (ID) of the source. Rays that continue to infinity after their last intercept are made 1.0 length unit long and painted red.

\item[{\tt [--mode|-m]}] Select mode [012] for this run.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\tt -m0]{Check syntax of input [default].}
\item[\tt -m1]{Output {\tt OFF} files useful to visualize the geometry\footnote{geomview availabe at \url{http://geomview.org}}.}
\item[\tt -m2]{Perform a ray tracing run.}
\end{itemize}

\item[{\tt [--threads|-t]}] {Set number of worker threads [1]. Typically, you want to set this parameter to the number of CPUs or cores available. Each worker thread uses its own rng seeded with {\tt seed}, {\tt seed}+1}, \ldots{}.

\item[{\tt [--help|-h]}] prints a help message.

\item[{\tt [--Version|-V]}] Prints the version number.

\end{list}


\section{Structure of the input file}
Input is given by a series of 'keyword'='value' pairs and parsed by {\tt libconfig}. Note, that each pair ends with ';', that keywords and strings\footnote{in double quotes.} are both case sensitive, and that float values \emph{must} contain a decimal point. {\tt libconfig} treats everything after the \# character until the end of the line as comment, is white space agnostic, and allows up to ten levels of included files (via the {\tt @include "filename"} directive. For details on the syntax used in the configuration files, please consult the documentation of {\tt libconfig}.
The general structure of the input --- the order of the keyword being unimportant --- is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
global_parameter_1 = value_1;
global_parameter_2 = value_2;
.
global_parameter_n = value_n;

sources = (
{definition of source_1},
{definition of source_2},
.
{definition of source_n}
);

targets = (
{definition of target_1}, 
{definition of target_2},
.
{definition of target_n}
);
\end{verbatim}

All sources and all targets are identified by their {\tt type}. The common {\tt name} keyword\footnote{must be unique.} is used as base name for the various output files\footnote{{\tt axes\_NAME.off} and {\tt NAME.off} (mode 1) and {\tt NAME.dat} for targets only (mode 2).}.

\subsection{Global Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\bf seed}:]{Seed value (unsigned integer) for random number generator. Using the same seed value again will result in the identical sequence of pseudo random number and thus an identical output.\footnote{This is not true anymore if you use more than one worker thread. First, each worker uses its own rng and seed value. Each produces a unique sequence of pseudo random numbers. Second, the exact sequence with which blocks of output from the different worker are interleaved in the final output is non-deterministic. Third, the amount of work performed by an individual worker is non-deterministic.}\\
The value will be overridden by the {\tt -a} command line argument. Using this option, existing results can be improved by tracing additional rays.}
\item[{\bf P\_factor}:]{Power represented by one (absorbed) ray. The number of rays to be tracked for each source is calculated as {\tt n\_rays} = {\tt power} / {\tt P\_factor}.}
\end{itemize}



\section{Sources}

All sources define the keywords {\tt origin} (doubles), {\tt power} (double), and {\tt spectrum} (string) i.e.\ the origin of the source, the total power assigned to the source, and the name of a file\footnote{The spectrum will be represented by a linear interpolation of the data given in this file. Use a minimum number of data points to make the interpolation fast} containing the spectrum of the source. Each ray thus represents a power of {\tt P\_factor} at a random wavelength.

\subsection{Transparent (non-interacting) Sources}

Rays that intercect these sources pass through them without being changed in any way.

\subsubsection{Arc}

\noindent {\tt type="arc";}

Defines an uniform spherical source of radius {\tt radius} located at {\tt origin}. Rays start at a random position inside the sphere in a random direction. Both, origin and direction of the ray are uniformly distributed.

\subsection{Solid (non-transparent, re-emitting) Sources}

Solid sources must have their reflectivity spectrum ({\tt reflectivity="FILE\_NAME"}) and a reflectivity model ({\tt reflectivity\_model="MODEL"}\footnote{see Sec.~\ref{sec:refl_models}}) defined. Rays that hit these sources can be reflected or absorbed. Absorbed ray are re-emitted again from this source as a random ray with the spectral characteristic of this source independently from their initial origin. Note, that also re-emission of a ray is counted as a reflection. Thus the number of reflection corresponds to the number of reflections and re-emission a ray experiences on his way from the \emph{original} sources until it is either absorbed or leaves the system.

\subsubsection{Solid Cone}

\noindent {\tt type="solid cone";}

\noindent {\tt name="NAME";}

Depending on settings for {\tt base\_face\_emits} and {\tt base\_face\_emits}, rays start at a random position on the cylinder wall only or also on one or two of its covering faces. Both, origin and direction of the ray are uniformly distributed. Faces that do not emit should be covered\footnote{Use a tiny offset} by a separate target of type disk with properly chosen optical properties to account for rays intercepted by the non-emitting surface(s).

\subsubsection{Solid Sphere}

\section{Targets}
All targets may use the optional keyword {\tt no\_output} ({\tt [true|false]}) that controls whether absorbed rays are logged for this target. The (implied) default is {\tt false} i.e.\ output is produced. All interacting\footnote{Targets that can absorb, refract, reflect, or scatter rays in contrast to {\it screens} that only register rays passing through them.} targets need the keywords {\tt reflectivity} (filename of spectral reflectivity) and {\tt reflectivity\_model} (see Sec.~\ref{sec:refl_models}) defined.

The structure of all output files (one for each target unless {\tt no\_output=True} is set) is identical: First, an ASCII header (lines starting with {\tt \#}) with name and type of the target, follwed by the transformation matrix $M$ and the origin $O$ required to transform from local to global coordinates. Then binary data sets (one per absorbed\footnote{or registered rays for screens} ray) follow consisting of 3\footnote{4, for non-planar targets} single precicions floats and one unsigned character that represent x, y, z\footnote{missing for planar targets}, $\lambda$, $n_{\mathrm{refl}}$.

\section{Utilities}

The structure of all output files (one for each target unless {\tt no\_output=True} is set) is identical: First, an ASCII header (lines starting with {\tt \#}) with name and type of the target, follwed by the transformation matrix $M$ and the origin $O$ required to transform from local to global coordinates. Then binary data sets (one per absorbed ray) follow consisting of 3\footnote{4, for non-planar targets} single precicions floats and one unsigned character (x, y, z\footnote{missing for planar targets}, $\lambda$, $n_{\mathrm{refl}}$) per absorbed ray.   

\subsection{{\tt spectrum}}

{\tt spectrum} reads the output file of a target produced by \rt and extract the spectrum (histogram) of the radiation absorbed by the target\footnote{or impinging on the target in case of a non-absorbing screen}. Statistical data of the spectrum are reported in its header including the number of rays and their total power that fall outside the range considered.

\item[{\tt [--stop|-o]}] Stop wavelength for spectrum [2000.0].
\item[{\tt [--help|-h]}] prints a help message.
\item[{\tt [--Version|-V]}] Prints the version number.

\end{list}

\subsection{{\tt flux\_2D}}
{\tt flux\_2D} outputs the distribution of the absorbed flux (2D histogram) of planar targets. Statistical data including the number of rays missed is reported in the header.

{\bf Syntax:} {\tt flux\_2D} [options] {\tt <} input {\tt >} output 2 {\tt >} errors

\item[{\tt [--miny|-y]}] Minimum y value of histogram [-10.0].
\item[{\tt [--maxy|-Y]}] Maximum y value of histogram [10.0].
\item[{\tt [--help|-h]}] prints a help message.
\item[{\tt [--Version|-V]}] Prints the version number.

\end{list}

\subsection{{\tt get\_flux}}
{\tt get\_flux} extracts the binary output datafiles producted by {\tt rt} and lists the data. It outputs\footnote{tab separated} $x$ $y$ $\lambda$ $n_{\mathrm{refl}}$ for planar targets or $x$ $y$ $z$ $\lambda$ $n_{\mathrm{refl}}$ otherwise.
