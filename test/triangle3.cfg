#
# triangle defined by the three vertices 'P1', 'P2', and 'P3'.
# the normal vector defined by ('P2' - 'P1') cross ('P2' - 'P1')
# points away from the reflecting face thus rays that intercept
# the triangle parallel to the normal vector are absorbed, those
# anti-parallel are reflected.
# the thre vectors ('P2' - 'P1'), ('P2' - 'P1') and the normal
# vector as defined above define a right handed system.
